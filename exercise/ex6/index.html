  <p>Set in the enchanting streets of Paris, <em>Charade</em> follows Regina Lampert (Audrey Hepburn), a young woman who returns from a ski trip to discover her husband, Charles Lampert, has been murdered. Her life is suddenly upended as she becomes entangled in a dangerous mystery involving stolen money, wartime secrets, and a trio of relentless pursuers.</p>
  <p>Regina learns that Charles had stolen a large sum of money during World War II and that three men—Tex Panthollow (James Coburn), Herman Scobie (George Kennedy), and Leopold W. Gideon (Ned Glass)—believe she knows where it’s hidden. Each man is convinced she holds the key to the fortune, and none of them are willing to let her go until they find it.</p>
  <p>Amid the chaos, Regina meets Peter Joshua (Cary Grant), a charming and mysterious stranger who offers to help her navigate the treacherous web of deceit. But as the story unfolds, Peter’s identity shifts, and Regina begins to question whether he’s truly an ally or just another player in the game.</p>
